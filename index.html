                        Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a probiotic is not
                        simply the sum of its individual components actions but the result of a complex
                        network of relationships between the microorganisms it contains and the human
                        host. Unlike many other products on the market, the clinical results obtained
                        from CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description.

                            It is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulazione De Simone falls
                            within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product s
                            base are living organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific
                            knowledge and specific know-how, still protected by industrial secrecy.

            <h4>CDS22-formula supports the dietary management of intestinal dysbiosis, contributing to well-being in
                cases of intestinal
                disorders connected to irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and paucities.</h4>
            <h3>Control of intestinal dysbiosis:</h3>
            <p>Intestinal dysbiosis is a condition where the natural balance of microorganisms in the intestine is
                altered, causing various
                gastrointestinal disorders. Controlling dysbiosis is crucial for maintaining digestive health, improving
                patient comfort, and contributing
                to overall well-being, even in cases of chronic intestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome,
                ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis.</p>
            <h3>Immediate and prolonged restoration of intestinal flora:</h3>
            <p>CDS22-formula is ideal for both acute and chronic episodes of intestinal dysbiosis. It reduces the
                severity and duration of symptoms,
                improving patient comfort and accelerating recovery. It is particularly indicated for supporting
                intestinal health and can be beneficial in
                cases of temporary or chronic intestinal disorders characterized by accelerated transit that prevents
                normal daily activities or
                adequate night rest.</p>
            <h3>Variety of Dosages:</h3>
            <p>Available in different formats and dosages to support intestinal health and adapt to individual dietary
                needs, offering flexibility to
                healthcare professionals in personalizing supplementation.</p>
            <h3>Original Formulation:</h3>
            <p>CDS22-formula is the original FormulazionDe Simone, a unique combination of proprietary bacterial strains
                designed to maximize
                intestinal well-being. The strains are cultivated and maintained in proprietary Master Cell Banks,
                ensuring purity, quality, and
                consistency in every production.</p>
            <h3>Guaranteed Safety:</h3>
            <p>Every dose has been tested to ensure maximum efficacy and safety. Thanks to a short supply chain approved
                by the inventor, the
                product maintains the highest quality standards from raw material to packaging.</p>
            <h3>Affordability:</h3>
            <p>CDS22-formula offers superior value compared to probiotics containing equivalent quantities of bacteria.
                Efficient production and
                direct cost control allow us to offer a more affordable product on the market.</p>
